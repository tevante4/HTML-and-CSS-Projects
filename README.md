HTML and CSS Projects
This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.
Projects:
• Space Station Site
• Movie Theater Site
• Portfolio 

Space Station Site
This page is an example home page for a Space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains
a navbar, image containers, and a form.

Movie Theater Site
This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Boostrap 4. It
contains many Boostrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form,
cards, and dropdowns.

Portfolio
This page is an example of a annotated compilation of everything learned thus far in during my HTML and CSS Course.
